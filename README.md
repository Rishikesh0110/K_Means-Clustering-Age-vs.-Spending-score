## Data Set
We have some basic data about customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. Spending Score is assigned to the customer based on some parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data. We will try to cluster this data according to these features.
## Used Algorithms
- K-Means clustering- Elbow Method
- Hierarchial clustering- Dendrogram
## Steps for K_Means 

## Steps For K-Means
The steps of the analysis are broken out into the following sections:

* Import the Data
* Prepare the Data
* Scale the data
* Find the Best Value for `k` Using the Original Data
* Build the Elbow Method with value of Inertia at dufferent value of K.
* Find the Best Value for `k` by elbow method.
* Cluster the mall with K-means.
* Visualize and Compare the Results with Silhautee Score
## Steps For Hierarchical Clustering
- Data Uploading
- Encoding
- scaling
- Generating Dendrogram using Plotly sch
- Model Creation AgglomerativeClustering
- Evaluation#Conclusion
By using AgglomerativeClustering (Hierarchial Clustering) & By k-means i generated clusters
